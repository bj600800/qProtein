MOL2 molecular structure format
===============================

The MOL2 file format is a popular method for specifying chemical structure, including atom types, positions, and bonding.
It is described in detail in the `Tripos documentation <http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/datamanip/dock/DOCK_4.0.1/html/Manual.41.html>`_.

Note that not all MOL2 bond types (e.g., ``am``, ``du``, ``un``, and ``nc``) are currently supported.
